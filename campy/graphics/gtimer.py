---------------
This file defines the <code>GTimer</code> class, which implements a
general interval timer.

A <code>GTimer</code> fires GTimerEvents on the EventQueue.
"""

# Implementation Note:
# While Stanford's CPP lib (as of 05/17) uses a GTimerData struct to manage reference counting,
# Python already handles reference counting and deletion for us.
# By implementing a __del__ method, we can specify what to do when the object is truly destroyed.
# TODO: Make sure that, when deletion on interpreter exit executes, that platform still exists.

# TODO: handle copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy() by supporting pickled methods
